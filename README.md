## About this Project

This project is a update of my personal project Radiola for learning and training Android Jetpack Compose.

The idea of the App is:

_"Create a player that plays anime songs stored in the cloud as Spotfy"._

## Functionalities

- Player to listen the selected song and also be able to:
	- Play/Pause the current song
	- Next/Previous song on the Playlist

## Built With

- [Android Jetpack's Navigation for compose] - Helps to implement navigation
- [Corroutines] - For asynchronous programming
- [Koin] - Dependency Injection Library
- [Firebase Firestore] Cloud NoSQL Database
- [Firebase Storage] - Object storage service
- [ExoPlayer] - An alternative to Android's MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video
- [MVVM Architecture] - Separation of the development of the graphical user interface from the development of the business logic.
